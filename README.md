# Slaying the Java Dragon
My Journey to Learning Java

I have tried and failed to learn Java twice in my life already. 
- 1st time was in university in my Computer Science courses - Got a C- (thanks to some very helpful friends)
- 2nd time was in a Web Development course in my mid-20s - failed miserably

What did both of these attempts have in common? I didn't really care.
My conclusion at the end of each of them was that I just wasn't cut out for programming. My brain didn't work that way and I just wasn't smart enough.

The first time round in university, my goal was to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible so that I could start making money and move out of my parents house. 
The second time I was on a student visa so that I could hang out in Canada beyond my work visa. 

Both times, my Java courses were just a wobbly stepping stone that I didn't care about and needed to survive. 

But, it's left this nagging feeling in me that I'm not smart enough to be a programmer. Because I had been defeated by this language twice already. 

My mission now is to learn Java and build some projects to prove to my younger self that if I had just applied myself, I could have done it.
